# task-2
This project is my Task 2 submission, where I built a simple full-stack app with both frontend and backend.  I used React for the frontend and Node.js + Express for the backend. The app features user registration and login with authentication to keep things secure. User data is saved in a database like MongoDB or MySQL.
